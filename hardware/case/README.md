# Case Shell
Exterior enclosure the word processor (work in progress)

This is the layout of all the plate components for the DIY word processor, including top cover, top plate, switch plate, and bottom plate. The switch plate is best made from a laser-cut sheet of ABS, however it can also be 3D printed.

Three of the plates have a handle section, which can be printed or cut as-is. The bottom plate has wells for the electronics as well as BL-5C batteries. There are interconnects between the electronics wells and the battery wells on the bottom plate. The side cutouts are intended for plugs or data storage attachments, such as micro-sd card slots. The keyboard supports Cherry MX style keyswitches and Costar stabilizers.
