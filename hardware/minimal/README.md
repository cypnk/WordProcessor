# Minimal Word Processor

This is a resource-limited variation of the word processor with both minimal and an alternative "full-function" shortcut version. Actual implementation will likely be the minimal version as a proof of concept.

The keyboard is an exploration of the bare minimum set of keys necessary to have a functional word processor while following the author's personal aesthetics.

## Keyboard layout

The key arrangement will be identical between shortcuts.

## Shortcuts

[Minimal command](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/blob/master/hardware/minimal/layout_cmd.json) version with only 10 shortcut commands.

[Full command](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/blob/master/hardware/minimal/layout_cmd_full.json) version which is mostly inspired by WordStar and a bit of WordPerfect.
