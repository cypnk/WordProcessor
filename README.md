# Word Processor
A DIY word processor for taking notes or drafting documents

This is a sketch area for some ideas on creating a utilitarian machine  
for journaling thoughts. This is strictly a personal project and I'm  
simply sharing my ideas on it.

Progress will be updated on my [personal blog](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/tags/computer) and results posted here.
