# Word Processor
A DIY word processor for taking notes or drafting documents

This is a sketch area for some ideas on creating a utilitarian machine  
for journaling thoughts. This is strictly a personal project and I'm  
simply sharing my ideas on it.

Progress will be updated on my [personal blog](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/tags/computer) and results posted here.

# Sub sections
The individual segments of the project
* [3D Printable case](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/case) - The outer casing including the keyboard switch plates. The cover and the bottom section will need to be attached together with separate hardware friction hinges.  
* [Compact keyboard](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/compact) - Version of the project using different hardware and keyboard layout.
