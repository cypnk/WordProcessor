# Word Processor
A DIY word processor for taking notes or drafting documents

This is a sketch area for some ideas on creating a utilitarian machine for journaling thoughts. This is strictly a personal project and I'm simply sharing my ideas on it.

Progress will be updated on my [personal blog](https://rc.sh2.us/tags/computer) also [mirrored on Tor](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/tags/computer) and results posted here.

## [3D Printable case](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/case) 
The outer casing including the keyboard switch plates. The cover and the bottom section will need to be attached together with separate hardware friction hinges. The center cavity is for a low profile single board computer with compartments on either side for BL-5C type batteries.

## [Compact keyboard](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/compact)
Version of the project using different hardware and keyboard layout and a smaller outer case.

Note: Cuts may be required in the gasket for the stabilizer retention clips, which need to be sealed separately with silicone or similar.

## [Minimal Word Processor](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/minimal)
A note taking and minimal editing version with the smallest number of features, intended as a proof of concept.

Alternative layout with possible editing features which may be implemented on different hardware.

Minimal version using only 1.5u keys for the most part, limiting stabilizer usage to the spacebar
