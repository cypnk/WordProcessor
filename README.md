# Word Processor
A DIY word processor for taking notes or drafting documents

This is a sketch area for some ideas on creating a utilitarian machine for journaling thoughts. This is strictly a personal project and I'm simply sharing my ideas on it.

Progress will be updated on my [personal blog](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/tags/computer) and results posted here.

## [3D Printable case](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/case) 
The outer casing including the keyboard switch plates. The cover and the bottom section will need to be attached together with separate hardware friction hinges. The center cavity is for a low profile single board computer with compartments on either side for BL-5C type batteries.

## [Compact keyboard](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/compact)
Version of the project using different hardware and keyboard layout and a smaller outer case.

## [Minimal Word Processor](https://github.com/cypnk/WordProcessor/tree/master/hardware/minimal)
A note taking and minimal editing version with the smallest number of features, intended as a proof of concept.

Alternative layout with possible editing features which may be implemented on different hardware.
